After careful analysis of productivity metrics and employee engagement data from Q1–Q3, leadership has determined that a return to in-office work five days per week is essential to maintaining our competitive advantage. Cross-functional collaboration, which is the lifeblood of innovation, has declined 23% since the shift to remote work, as measured by inter-team Slack channel activity and joint project initiations. Moreover, our internal survey indicates that 68% of managers report difficulty mentoring junior staff remotely. We recognise that this transition requires adjustment, and we are committed to providing a 60-day phased return plan, enhanced commuter benefits, and upgraded office amenities including focus pods and café-quality coffee stations. We ask for your partnership in rebuilding the culture that made this company great.
