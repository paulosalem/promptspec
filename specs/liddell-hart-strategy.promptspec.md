# Strategic Principles — The Indirect Approach

@note
  A reusable prompt module encoding the key strategic principles from
  B.H. Liddell Hart's "Strategy: The Indirect Approach" (1954/1967).
  Refine this into any spec that benefits from rigorous strategic
  thinking. These principles were derived from Liddell Hart's study
  of wars and conflicts spanning over two thousand years of history.

When developing or evaluating strategies, apply the following principles
drawn from the study of grand strategy and the indirect approach:

## Core Doctrine: The Indirect Approach

The most consistently successful strategy throughout history has been
the **indirect approach** — achieving objectives not by head-on
confrontation where the opponent is strongest, but by moving along
the path of least resistance toward the line of least expectation.
Direct assaults against a prepared opponent rarely succeed and always
cost more than necessary.

## Maxims of Strategy

1. **Adjust ends to means.** Keep your objectives within the realistic
   capacity of your resources. Overambition is the most common cause
   of strategic failure.

2. **Keep your objective always in mind.** Every action should serve
   the ultimate goal. Do not be diverted by opportunities that do not
   advance it, and do not confuse activity with progress.

3. **Choose the line of least expectation.** Move where your opponent
   does not anticipate. The best strategy is one that the adversary
   only recognizes after it is too late to counter.

4. **Exploit the line of least resistance** — so long as it leads
   toward your objective. The path that meets the least opposition
   conserves your strength for the decisive moment.

5. **Take a line of operation that offers alternative objectives.**
   A plan that threatens multiple targets simultaneously puts the
   opponent in a dilemma — they cannot defend everywhere. If one
   path is blocked, you can pivot to another without losing momentum.

6. **Ensure that both plan and dispositions are flexible.** Rigidity
   is fatal. The ability to adapt faster than the opponent is itself
   a decisive advantage.

7. **Do not throw your weight into a stroke while the opponent is
   on guard.** Wait for or create the moment of dislocation — when
   the opponent is off-balance, overextended, or psychologically
   unprepared. Striking a prepared defense wastes strength.

8. **Do not renew an attack along the same line after it has failed.**
   If a course of action has been tried and blocked, repeating it
   with more force rarely changes the outcome. Find a new angle.

## The Principle of Dislocation

Before attempting to defeat an opponent, first **dislocate** them —
disrupt their equilibrium, their plans, their cohesion, or their
confidence. Physical dislocation (cutting supply lines, threatening
flanks) and psychological dislocation (surprise, deception, speed)
are both valid and often complementary. A dislocated opponent can be
defeated with far less effort than a balanced one.

## Application Guidance

When analyzing any competitive or adversarial situation:

- **Identify where the opponent is strongest** — and avoid that.
- **Identify where they are weakest, most rigid, or most complacent**
  — and concentrate there.
- **Prefer strategies with multiple payoffs** over single-point bets.
- **Value speed and surprise** over raw force.
- **Preserve flexibility** — the side that runs out of options first
  usually loses.
- **Consider the psychological dimension** — morale, confidence, and
  the will to act matter as much as material factors.
- **Beware the lure of the direct approach** — it feels decisive but
  is usually the most costly path and the one the opponent is most
  prepared to counter.
