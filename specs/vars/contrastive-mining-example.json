  "text_a": "After careful analysis of productivity metrics and employee engagement data from Q1–Q3, leadership has determined that a return to in-office work five days per week is essential to maintaining our competitive advantage. Cross-functional collaboration, which is the lifeblood of innovation, has declined 23% since the shift to remote work, as measured by inter-team Slack channel activity and joint project initiations. Moreover, our internal survey indicates that 68% of managers report difficulty mentoring junior staff remotely. We recognise that this transition requires adjustment, and we are committed to providing a 60-day phased return plan, enhanced commuter benefits, and upgraded office amenities including focus pods and café-quality coffee stations. We ask for your partnership in rebuilding the culture that made this company great.",

  "text_b": "I've been working remotely for three years now, and honestly? I've never been more productive. Last quarter I shipped two major features ahead of schedule — something I couldn't have done in an open-plan office with constant interruptions. My commute used to eat two hours a day; now I spend that time exercising and actually being present for my kids' bedtime. And here's the thing: I collaborate just fine. My team does async standups, weekly video deep-dives, and we pair-program over screen share when we need to. I'm not saying the office is evil — it's great for some people. But forcing everyone back feels like solving a management problem by punishing the people who figured out how to work better. Let us choose."
