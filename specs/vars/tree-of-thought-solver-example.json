  "problem": "A startup has 3 engineers and needs to ship an MVP in 6 weeks. They must choose between: (A) a polished web app with limited features, (B) a feature-rich prototype with rough UX, or (C) a CLI tool plus API with no frontend. Each engineer can only focus on one major component. How should they allocate work to maximize chances of getting paying customers?"
